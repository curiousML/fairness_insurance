**Abstract**: AI systems rely heavily on labeled data to make decisions, yet these datasets often contain biases originating from human decisions or societal inequities. This issue is especially evident in insurance pricing, where regulatory frameworks differ across countries. For instance, in car insurance, some jurisdictions allow the consideration of personal factors unrelated to driving such as credit history, employment, or gender, while others prohibit their use due to concerns of unfair discrimination. Unfortunately, even after removing these sensitive variables, biases persist. In response to the pressing need to mitigate bias in data-driven decision-making, algorithmic fairness has emerged as a significant concern within the field of machine learning. Despite its widespread application in insurance, there remains a lack of research addressing multi-class classification problems from a fairness perspective, particularly within the insurance sector. In this study, we extend both exact and approximate fairness definitions, focusing specifically on Demographic Parity, to the domain of multi-class classification. Our approach provides novel insights and methodologies directly relevant to the insurance industry. The proposed plug-in procedure is supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, showcasing its capability to closely approximate the behavior of an optimal fair rule while preserving efficacy in risk assessment. Evaluation on both synthetic and real insurance datasets underscores the effectiveness of our approach in achieving predefined levels of fairness.
